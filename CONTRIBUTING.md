Any contributions are appreciated! Please check issues and prioritize those or identify bugs and fix those. If you see a place where better practices could be used, please tell me or fix it yourself! 

I ask that you don't submit any changes to the master, but create a pull request for me to approve and I will try to review your changes as quickly as possible and impliment them into the master if I find them suitable.

Thank you again to everyone in the open source community who chooses to contribute to this project!
